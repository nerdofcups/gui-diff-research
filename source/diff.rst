I propose to treat of Poetry in itself and of its various kinds,
noting the essential quality of each, to inquire into the structure of
the plot as requisite to a  poem; into the number and nature of
the parts of which a poem is composed; and similarly into whatever
else falls within the same inquiry. Following, then, the order of
nature, let us begin with the principles which come first.

Epic poetry and Tragedy, Comedy also and Dithyrambic poetry, and the
music of the flute and of the lyre in most of their forms, are all in
their general conception modes of imitation. They differ, however,
from one another in three respects- the medium, the objects, the
manner or mode of imitation, being in each case distinct.

For as there are persons who, by conscious art or mere habit, imitate
and represent various objects through the medium of color and form, or
again by the voice; so in the arts above mentioned, taken as a whole,
the imitation is produced by rhythm, language, or 'harmony,' either
singly or combined.

Thus in the music of the flute and of the lyre, 'harmony' and rhythm
alone are employed; also in other arts, such as that of the shepherd's
pipe, which are essentially similar to these. In dancing, rhythm alone
is used without 'harmony'; for even dancing imitates character,
emotion, and action, by rhythmical movement.

There is another art which imitates by means of language alone, and
that either in prose or verse- which verse, again, may either combine
different meters or consist of but one kind- but this has hitherto
been without a name. For there is no common term we could apply to the
mimes of Sophron and Xenarchus and the Socratic dialogues on the one
hand; and, on the other, to poetic imitations in iambic, elegiac, or
any similar meter. People do, indeed, add the word 'maker' or 'poet'
to the name of the meter, and speak of elegiac poets, or epic (that
is, hexameter) poets, as if it were not the imitation that makes the
poet, but the verse that entitles them all to the name. Even when a
treatise on medicine or natural science is brought out in verse, the
name of poet is by custom given to the author; and yet Homer and
Empedocles have nothing in common but the meter, so that it would be
right to call the one poet, the other physicist rather than poet. On
the same principle, even if a writer in his poetic imitation were to
combine all meters, as Chaeremon did in his Centaur, which is a medley
composed of meters of all kinds, we should bring him too under the
general term poet.
